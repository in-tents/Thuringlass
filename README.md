# Thuringlass
Open source politics

### I am a hippy, not a programmer

## The core issues
1) Politics has soured as a profession. No one answers the question asked, no one fulfills promises made, they try to convince you they deserve power rather than being deserving of it.
2) voters don't care. They can't care about something that is incentivized to be uncared about, especially when it's wrapped in stupid legalese.
3) there isn't a way to meaningfully participate. Sure I can vote, but the data has proven how little impact my vote actually has on deciding outcomes. The sheer volume of uninformed/hivemind votes makes mine pointless anyway.

I do not pretend to have a blanket solution, but I offer a step in the right direction.
What if every political stance, vote, and campaign promise was tracked on-chain?
What if I could know that someone 1) didn't answer the question, 2) is spewing misinformation, and 3) details that provide needed context for you to make your own conclusion?
While this doesn't counter voter apathy behaviour directly, at least other votes have no excuse to be uninformed or for "my party".

# Proposed Features for Thuringlass

### Promise Identification
* Tracks speeches, interviews, social media
* Specifically looks for policy commitments or stances regarding existing or proposed policy

### Reputation Scoring
social credit for those proposing it
* Tracks reliability of stance, not based on party lines but how easily they change their worldview
  * For example: "Ban tiktok! Chinese spyware! It's so bad!" to "Oh hey look at me I unbanned tiktok I'm so amazing LOVE ME PEASANTS" is not fucking normal
* Tracks the ratio of promises made to promises fulfilled 
* Scope must be defined for when their public information is tracked, this cannot sour into a People's Palantir.
* We do not deal in personal attacks, just the data.
  * An opinion is a narrow slice of the truth, I'd rather present the data and let you inform your own.
* Probably the only actual score is the ratio of promises made to fulfilled.

### Debate Assist
Post-Production Fact-Checking and Debate Analysis
* Accessible language, one must not cast off a chastity belt just to castrate oneself.
* Real-time fact checking, argument analysis, and relevant context.
* If a topic is too complex to simply fact check, then there should be a way for you to easily educate yourself on-platform, but like 3rd party breakdowns summarized.
  * Not "this is the right view" but "here's what recognized experts think about this thing" 

Regarding information tracking:
At a point yet to be determined, ideally once they officially begin running for office, their public information is tracked (social media, interviews, personal public media like blogs or news letters) BUT ONLY from the date that they began running until they leave office or the race.
When they are not in office or running, the data is only available on-chain, not the user facing app.
There will need to be a forward facing app for thuringlass and then a block-chain interface for transparency and accountability. There will be an API so that you can call for data and have your personal AI do the explaining and fact checking.

### ok but WHY crypto blockchain sketchy bullshit
the current regime is already beginning to censor things.
I will not give easy access to my colon.
